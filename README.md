# asian-foods-scraper

This project leverages Selenium, a powerful web automation tool, to extract detailed information about asian foods, such as rice, seaweed, noodles, etc. The primary goal is to gather and organize food-related data into a structured format, such as spreadsheets or CSV files, for analysis.

For ease of use, the python code has been transformed into an executable file that can be run on any machine without the need to install any dependencies. The executable file is located in the `dist` folder. Here's the interface of the executable file:
